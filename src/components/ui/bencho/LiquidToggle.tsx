/* ══ Liquid ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Three metaball studies: a toggle, a reorderable list, and
   a create menu.

   RECONSTRUCTED. The original file was destroyed; this is
   rebuilt against the surviving stylesheet, which specifies
   the geometry, the layering and the timing exactly. The
   behaviour matches what index.css and the catalog demos
   require. The original's internal reasoning is not
   recoverable and is not reproduced here.

   ── the shared constraint ───────────────────────────────
   Everything on a filtered layer must be OPAQUE. The goo
   filter thresholds alpha, so a translucent fill under it
   disappears. That is why each of these has two layers: an
   opaque blob layer that carries the filter, and an unfiltered
   layer above it carrying the text — antialiased type would
   be eaten by the same threshold. */

   Two blobs, not one. The thumb crosses at once and a smaller
   drop follows it late, so for most of the crossing the pair
   is stretched into a single waisted capsule. They must stay
   OVERLAPPED — a goo bridge across a real gap comes out thin
   and reads as two blobs and a thread. */

   its slot; five is a droplet sitting in one.

   PAD is the same five, and it has to be: the inset at the
   ends and the inset above and below are the same gap seen
   twice, and at 40/4 they were 3 and 4 — near enough to look
   like a mistake rather than a decision.

   The size is handed to the stylesheet as `--liq-thumb`

     The filter existed to fuse the thumb with the straggler

     alpha, and two overlapping circles come out as one waisted
     capsule. With the straggler gone it had one circle to
     work on, and a blur-then-threshold pass over a single
     round shape cannot improve it — it can only soften the
     edge, which is exactly what it was doing. That is the
     answer to "why does the dot look low definition": it was
     being rasterised, blurred nine pixels and re-cut at a
     contrast of 19, every frame, for no gain.

     A plain DOM circle with a border-radius is drawn by the
     browser at device resolution and stays crisp at any zoom
     the wall or the canvas asks for. The stretch is a CSS
     transform now rather than a deformation the filter had to

     The thumb's x is a motion value rather than a prop, which

     one of them having to know about the other: a drag writes
     it directly, a release animates it, and nothing re-renders
     either way.

     The straggler is a SPRING FOLLOWING that value. It used to
     be the same target with a delay on it, which is a good
     description of a click and a poor one of a drag — a delay
     means the drop sets off late and arrives at a place the
     thumb left; a spring means it is always chasing wherever
     the thumb is now, and it stretches by exactly as much as
     you are moving. Drag slowly and the pair stays one shape;

     There was a second, smaller blob running behind this one

     a thread — which is what a trail IS, and what it looks
     like: a droplet dragging a tail, or at speed two separate
     circles. The dragging ball had the same thing and lost it
     for the same reason; its note is the long version.

     What replaces it is the ball's own answer. The ONE body
     lengthens along its direction of travel and thins across
     it, so the elasticity is in the shape of the thing moving
     rather than in something left behind — and there is
     nothing to leave behind, because there is nothing behind
     it.

     Area is kept: scaleY is 1/scaleX, so the thumb is the same

     a second, so dividing by 1400 asked it to reach 1400 to
     mean anything: measured, the stretch peaked at 1.039 —
     arithmetically present and invisible. 600 puts the peak at
     about 1.09 at the default, which is the ball's own kind of
     give, and the cap at 0.4 leaves the top of the knob
     somewhere to go. */

  /* ── the hover swell goes in the SAME transform ──────────
     It was the CSS `scale` property, on the reasoning that
     `scale` is its own property and would compose with
     whatever the transform was doing. It composes, but not
     independently: the individual transform properties apply
     BEFORE `transform`, so `scale: 1.035` scaled the
     coordinate system that `translateX(51px)` then moved
     through — 51 became 52.8, and the droplet drifted toward
     the end of the track it was already sitting at.

     It only showed on the ON state, and the arithmetic says
     why: the error is the translate times 3.5%, and the
     translate is 5 when the switch is off and 51 when it is
     on. Measured at 51 — the right margin should have gone
     5 to 4.37 and went to 2.58 instead.

     Multiplied into scaleX and scaleY here, it is a swell
     about the droplet's own centre and the position is
     untouched. The stretch stays area-preserving inside it. */

  /* ── how the thumb lands when it is let go ───────────────
     Bounce is the damping and Speed is the stiffness, so both
     knobs are properties of one spring rather than of a curve.

     SOFTER THAN IT WAS. At 220/20 the default zeta was 0.71
     and the crossing was quick with a visible snap at the end
     — a switch throwing itself to the other side. 170/21.5 is
     zeta 0.87: it still arrives with a hint of give, and the
     hint is the whole of it. The dragging ball is the
     reference, and what makes that one feel gentle is not a
     slow spring but the absence of a hard stop; the same
     applies here, and the goo doing the necking is the other
     half of it.

     Damping is a constant now. It was the Bounce knob, and a
     switch is not a thing anybody wants a bounce dial on: the
     whole range from dead to lively is the difference between
     a control that works and one that is showing off, and 21.5
     is the answer. Speed still moves, because how fast a
     switch crosses is a real question. */

       This used to decide here: grabbed on the thumb it kept
       the offset you took hold of, and grabbed anywhere else
       it set the offset to half a thumb so the droplet "came
       to the finger and centred under it". It did not come —
       it TELEPORTED. `x.set()` is a hard write with no spring
       behind it, so the first pointermove after an off-thumb
       press moved the droplet the whole way in a single frame.
       Measured: pressed at 80 with the droplet at 5, it went
       46px between two frames.

       Taking the offset at the first move instead means that
       move produces no displacement at all and every one after
       it tracks the delta — so a drag always starts from where
       the droplet actually is. There is no press anywhere on
       this control that can make it jump.

       What it costs: an off-thumb press-and-drag no longer
       brings the droplet under your finger, it moves it by how
       far you dragged. On a 92px track you are never far from
